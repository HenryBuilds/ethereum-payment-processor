# 💳 Ethereum Payment Processor

A simple, automated Ethereum payment processor that generates unique wallets for each payment and forwards received ETH to your main address.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **HD Wallet Generation** - Unique address for each payment
- 👀 **Automatic Monitoring** - Polls Etherscan API for incoming payments
- ⚡ **Auto-Forward** - Automatically forwards ETH to your main address
- 🛡️ **Gas Optimization** - Calculates optimal gas fees
- 📊 **REST API** - Simple endpoints for payment creation and status

## ⚙️ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file:
```bash
MASTER_ADDRESS=0x...                                    # Your main ETH address
RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com         # For testnet
# RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID  # For mainnet
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Get RPC Access (Free)
Choose one option:

**🔸 Infura** (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [infura.io](https://infura.io)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your Project ID
4. Use: `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID`

**🔸 Alchemy**
1. Sign up at [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your API key
4. Use: `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY`

**🔸 Public RPC** (No signup required)
- `https://ethereum.publicnode.com`
- `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth`

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm run build && npm start
```

## 🔧 API Usage

### Create Payment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payment/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "0.1",
    "orderId": "ORDER_123"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "paymentId": "uuid-here",
    "address": "0x...",
    "amount": "0.1"
  }
}
```

### Check Payment Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/payment/{paymentId}/status
```

### List All Payments
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/payments
```

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Payment Creation** → Generates a new HD wallet
2. **Customer Payment** → Customer sends ETH to the generated address
3. **Monitoring** → System polls Etherscan API every 30 seconds
4. **Auto-Forward** → Once payment is detected, forwards ETH to your main address
5. **Completion** → Payment status updated to 'completed'

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Keep your `MASTER_ADDRESS` private key secure
- The system only needs your receiving address, not private keys
- Each payment wallet's private key is generated and stored temporarily
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Monitor gas prices for cost optimization
